\section{Introduction}
    This document provides an overview of the \acrfull{srs} for the \acrfull{wbr} project of Group 1. The current section explains purpose of this project, purpose of this document, scope of the software, organization of this document and the characteristics of the intended readers.
    \subsection{Purpose of Project}
        The \acrshort{wbr} project is to develop the software of a fully-autonomous delivery robot, based on the existing hardware assembly provided by the \acrfull{macrm}. Since the hardware platform is a fixed constraint, \acrshort{wbr} focuses on the software only, while the \acrshort{macrm} is responsible for the hardware design, provision, and maintenance.
    \subsection{Purpose of Document}
        This document is crafted to furnish a comprehensive set of system requirements for the development of a wheeled biped robot. It encompasses a broad spectrum of aspects, including general behaviors, functional breakdown, and in-depth performance criteria. It delves into strategies for addressing unforeseen circumstances and the likelihood of changes in these requirements. This document plays an important role in pushing the progress of the project, and establishing a solid foundation for the design phase.It also acts as a benchmark to evaluate whether the future design meets all specified requirements.

\section{Scope}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work}
The wheeled biped robot responds to user commands, with the user serving as the primary point of interaction, determining the robot's intended routes and desired motions. The control system, an automated component, manages fundamental operations and behavior of the wheeled biped robot in accordance with pre-programmed algorithms. It processes data received from sensors, which detect obstacles and unfamiliar terrain. The motor system primarily handles the robot's mechanical movements.


\subsection{Context Diagram showing Boundaries}

\end{figure}
The following picture shows the design of the context diagram of the project, it illustrates the core interaction between the wheeled biped robot and its immediate external entities. In this diagram, the wheeled biped robot is the central system, the sensor sends inputs regarding the road condition and obstables, which acts as the external entity. The control system is another external entity that monitors the robot. The motor is used to drive the motion of the robot. This is consistent with what is described in the scope.

\section{Behaviour}
\subsection{Behaviour Overview with Notation}
To make the behaviour of the product to achieve the target task, the Finite State Machine is created to describe the behaviour with detailed description provided after the picture. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{FSM.jpg}
    \caption{The Picture of Finite  State Machine}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Brief Behaviour Description}
The FSM diagram briefly introduces the following general behaviours. The description is given below:\\\\
\noindent\textbf{Waiting for User Commands:} When the wheeled biped robot is positioned on the ground, in the absence of any initial user commands, it enters an "Idle" state. During this state, the robot's motor system is powered on, and the robot readies itself to receive and respond to user commands once they are initiated. \\\\
\noindent\textbf{Following a Path:} Upon receiving a navigation command, the robot initiates movement and begins the process of pathfinding to determine the most suitable route to follow.\\\\
\textbf{Obstacles Avoidance:}When the sensor detects nearby obstacles, it communicates this information to the control system. Subsequently, the control system takes action to navigate and bypass the obstacles to ensure the robot's safe passage.   \\\\
\textbf{Halt Current Task:} The system temporarily interrupts the ongoing path travel task and initiates the execution of a special task.\\\\
\textbf{Complete Required Tasks:} If special commands are issued while the robot is in motion, the robot promptly executes the specified tasks. These tasks may involve actions such as adjusting posture (e.g., lifting legs), changing direction (turning around), or performing dynamic movements like jumping. \\\\
